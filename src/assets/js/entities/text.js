    intro_text: "<p>The federal government tracks infection control at hospitals nationwide, releasing new data quarterly. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution uses the data to analyze the performance of more than two dozen metro Atlanta hospitals. This information shows how often patients contract infections while getting care, when compared to similar hospitals. Public health experts say these types of infections are preventable if hospitals carefully follow protocols for infection prevention. This information is collected by the National Healthcare Safety Network at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The federal government uses a standardized infection ratio (SIR) to measure how well hospitals are doing on infection control. The SIR compares the number of infections in a hospital to a national benchmark. The information below is based on data collected from 10/1/2013 to 9/30/2014.<br><strong>Lower numbers are better. A score of zero – meaning no infections – is best.</strong></p><p>The AJC has data on these types of hospital-acquired infections – <a href='https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/about/complications.html' target='_blank'>click to find out more about this type of infection.</a></p><p>Select one of the measures below to see how metro Atlanta hospitals rate:</p>",
    bottom_text: "<h4>Standardized Infection Ratio</h4><p>Dots on the graph above indicate a hospital's standardized infection ratio, or SIR. The colored bars show the SIR's 95 percent confidence interval, which indicates the precision of the calculated SIR. Wider bars indicate less precision.</p><p>To arrive at the SIR, the government calculates the number of infections that are predicted at a given hospital and compares that to the reported number. To calculate the predicted number, the CDC uses benchmark rates from the years 2006 to 2008 for CLABSI and SSI, and from 2009 for CAUTI. Benchmark rates for hospital onset MRSA bacteremia and C. difficile are from 2010-2011. The kinds of patients a hospital serves also is a factor.</p><ul><li><strong>If SIR is 1:</strong> the number of infections reported is the same as the number of predicted infections.</li><li><strong>If SIR is less than 1:</strong> there were fewer infections reported than predicted given the baseline data.</li><li><strong>If SIR is more than 1:</strong> there were more infections reported than predicted given the baseline data.</li></ul><p>Note: The National Healthcare Safety Network, the CDC’s system that collects this data, is highly respected. But even those who run it would like to see more validation of the data to make sure hospitals are accurately reporting their figures.</p>"
